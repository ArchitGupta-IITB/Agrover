Image Detection in the ITSP Project

ITSP- Institute Technical Summer Project is organized by IIT Bombay in the Summer

Image detection was done using image processing. 

We filtered to find the amount of leaf that is diseased and use that as a reference to decide for image to be diseased or not

We also tried a ML model but was unsuccessful for the same but found it a little unreliable.

The folder conatains the various test cases that can be used and training data for the ML stuff
